This Java application simulates a digital library checkout system using Java collections, custom iterators, and exception handling. Users can browse books by genre, borrow and return books, and demonstrate patterns of iterator design in real-world scenarios. The system uses maps, lists, and other Java collections to store and organize books, and provides custom iterators to list only available books by genre.
